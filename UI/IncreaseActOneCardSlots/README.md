## Installation (manual)

To install this plugin first you need to install BepInEx as a mod loader for Inscryption. 

A guide to do this can be found [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html#where-to-download-bepinex). Inscryption needs the 86x (32 bit) mono version.

To install this mod, you simply need to extract the zip that comes from this download to it's own folder in **path_to_BepInEx_install/BepInEx/plugins**.
